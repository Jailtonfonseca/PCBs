</p>

**PCBGeniusAI** is an ambitious, open-source project to create a revolutionary, AI-powered software suite that automates and optimizes the entire Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design workflow. Imagine an intelligent assistant that understands your requirements, generates schematics, lays out your board, and even prepares the documentation for you.

Our mission is to empower electronic engineers, hardware startups, hobbyists, and academic institutions by making PCB design faster, smarter, and more accessible.

## üåü Vision

We envision an **AI co-pilot** that works alongside the designer. You are always in control, but the AI handles the tedious, repetitive, and complex tasks. From interpreting a high-level description of a circuit to suggesting optimal component placements and routing strategies, PCBGeniusAI aims to be an indispensable partner in hardware creation.

## ‚ú® Key Features (The Roadmap)

Our development is guided by a feature-rich roadmap that will be rolled out incrementally.

### 1. Intuitive Requirements Input
Forget rigid forms. Describe your project in plain English, provide a block diagram, or use a structured input form. The AI will interpret your needs and translate them into actionable design parameters.

### 2. AI-Powered Schematic Generation
The system will automatically select appropriate components based on your requirements and generate a clean, well-organized schematic. The AI will provide suggestions and alternatives, explaining its choices along the way.

### 3. Intelligent PCB Layout Automation
Our AI will suggest optimal component placements and automatically route the PCB, adhering to design rules and optimizing for signal integrity, thermal performance, and manufacturability. You can guide the process or let the AI do the heavy lifting.

### 4. Automated Fabrication & Documentation
Generate a complete set of fabrication files (Gerbers, BOM, PnP) with a single click. The system will also create comprehensive technical documentation for your project, saving you hours of work.

## üèóÔ∏è Software Architecture

PCBGeniusAI is being built on a modern, scalable **microservices architecture**. Each core function (e.g., schematic generation, PCB layout, component database) is an independent service. This design ensures flexibility, resilience, and the ability to scale each part of the system as needed.

## üöÄ Current Status & Getting Started

This project is currently in a **very early, foundational stage of development**.

The existing functionality is limited to defining basic project-level and power supply block requirements through a command-line interface.

To test the current Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for requirements input:

1.  Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2.  Clone this repository.
3.  Navigate to the project root and run:
    ```bash
    python core/requirements_parser.py
    ```
4.  The script will prompt you to enter project details.
