# PCBGeniusAI - Phased Development Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a phased development plan for PCBGeniusAI, from the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to more advanced features. Each phase builds upon the previous one, progressively delivering more value and sophistication. The plan includes high-level effort estimations for each module to provide a rough idea of complexity and development time.

**Effort Estimation Key:**
*   **S**: Small (Relatively simple, quick to implement)
*   **M**: Medium (Moderate complexity, requires significant development)
*   **L**: Large (High complexity, substantial development effort)
*   **XL**: Extra Large (Very high complexity, potentially requiring extensive research and development)

## 2. Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The MVP focuses on delivering the core end-to-end functionality of generating a basic PCB design from parameterized user inputs. The goal is to validate the fundamental concept and gather early user feedback.

**Core Functionalities:**
*   Users can input PCB requirements through a structured form (e.g., selecting component types from a predefined list, specifying parameters like voltage, current, number of I/Os).
*   The system can generate a schematic for a limited set of common, relatively simple electronic functions (e.g., basic linear voltage regulator, a simple microcontroller breakout with essential passives, LED driver circuit).
*   The system provides basic AI-assisted PCB layout, including component placement suggestions for the selected components and simple, automated routing for a 2-layer board.
*   The system can generate Gerber files (RS-274X format) for fabrication and a basic Bill of Materials (BOM) listing the components used.

**Deliverables:**
1.  Web-based UI for parameterized requirements input.
2.  Schematic generation module for a limited set of predefined circuit blocks.
3.  Component database with a small, curated set of common components (symbols, footprints).
4.  Basic AI-assisted PCB layout module (placement guidance, simple auto-router).
5.  Gerber file generation module.
6.  Basic BOM generation module (CSV or simple text format).
7.  Deployed application accessible to a limited set of test users.
