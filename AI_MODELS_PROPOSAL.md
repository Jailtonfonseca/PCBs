## 2. AI Techniques by Module

### 2.1. User Interface (UI) & Requirements Interpretation Module

This module is the primary entry point for user input and requires robust AI to understand diverse forms of requirements.

#### 2.1.1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Text Requirements

*   **Models**:
    *   **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) / RoBERTa (A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach)**:
        *   **Suitability**: These models are excellent for understanding context in text. They can be fine-tuned for tasks like intent recognition (e.g., "create a power supply," "design a filter") and named entity recognition (NER) to extract key parameters like "5V," "1A," "Arduino compatible," "low-pass filter," "resistor," "capacitor."
    *   **GPT Variants (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, or smaller fine-tunable versions from Hugging Face Transformers like DistilGPT-2, GPT-Neo)**:
        *   **Suitability**: Powerful for more generative or complex understanding tasks. Can be used for zero-shot or few-shot learning to interpret requirements, summarize design goals, or even ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous. Larger models might be used via APIs, while smaller ones can be fine-tuned.
*   **Techniques**:
    *   **Fine-tuning Pre-trained Models**: Adapt general-purpose language models to the specific jargon and sentence structures found in electronics design requirements. Requires a curated dataset of electronics project descriptions or requirements.
    *   **Entity Linking**: Link extracted entities (e.g., "LM7805") to specific components in the Component Database.

#### 2.1.2. Diagram Interpretation (Future Enhancement)

*   **Models**:
    *   **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (e.g., ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet)**:
        *   **Suitability**: Standard for image feature extraction. Can be trained to identify symbols (resistors, capacitors, ICs) and basic connections if users upload hand-drawn sketches or simple block diagrams.
    *   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**:
        *   **Suitability**: If diagrams can be parsed into a graph structure (nodes as components, edges as connections), GNNs can learn the relationships and interpret the diagram's function or structure more effectively than CNNs alone.
*   **Techniques**:
    *   **Object Detection (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN)**: Train models to locate and classify electronic symbols within an image.
    *   **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: To extract text (e.g., component values, labels) from diagrams.

#### 2.1.3. Requirements Validation & Refinement

*   **Techniques/Models**:
    *   **Expert Systems / Rule-Based Engines**:
        *   **Suitability**: Encode domain knowledge (e.g., "a 5V logic circuit cannot directly drive a 12V relay without a driver"). Useful for validating basic electrical compatibility and completeness of specifications.
    *   **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) Solvers**:
        *   **Suitability**: Define requirements as variables and constraints, then use solvers to find inconsistencies or ambiguities (e.g., conflicting voltage and current requirements for a component).
    *   **Supervised ML Models (e.g., Classifiers like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)**:
        *   **Suitability**: Train models on examples of valid/invalid or complete/incomplete specifications to predict issues with new user inputs. Requires a labeled dataset of requirements.

This module translates validated requirements into a functional electronic schematic.

#### 2.2.1. Topology Selection

*   **Models**:
    *   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**:
        *   **Suitability**: Schematics are inherently graphs. GNNs can learn structural patterns from a dataset of existing schematics and classify or recommend appropriate circuit topologies (e.g., buck converter, Wien bridge oscillator) based on input requirements.
    *   **Supervised Classifiers (e.g., SVM, Multilayer Perceptron)**:
        *   **Suitability**: If circuit characteristics (input voltage, output current, function type) can be featurized, these models can predict a suitable topology from a predefined list. Simpler to implement than GNNs if graph complexity is not initially required.
*   **Techniques**:
    *   **Learning from Categorized Schematics**: Requires a dataset where schematics are labeled with their functional topology and key design parameters.

#### 2.2.2. Component Selection

*   **Models/Techniques**:
    *   **Content-Based Filtering**:
        *   **Suitability**: Matches component specifications (voltage, current, tolerance, package type from the Component Database) against the interpreted user requirements. This is a primary method.

        *   **Suitability**: For standard, well-defined connections (e.g., connecting VCC/GND pins, microcontroller peripheral connections based on pin functions). Highly reliable for common patterns.
    *   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**:
        *   **Suitability**: Can predict missing links or validate connections in a partially generated schematic graph by learning common connectivity patterns from existing valid schematics.
    *   **Sequence Generation Models (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers - more experimental for this task)**:
        *   **Suitability**: If netlist generation can be framed as a sequence (e.g., connecting pins in a specific order for certain sub-circuits), these models might be applicable, though GNNs are likely a more natural fit.

        *   **State**: Current state of the PCB layout, including placed components and existing tracks, and design rule constraints.
        *   **Action**: Choose direction and layer for the next segment of a track.
        *   **Reward**: Based on successful connection, track length, number of vias, adherence to design rules (clearances, width), and signal integrity metrics.
        *   **Suitability**: Highly promising for learning complex routing strategies that adapt to dense boards and strict design rules. Can potentially outperform traditional auto-routers that rely heavily on predefined heuristics.
    *   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for State Representation**:

#### 2.3.3. SI/PI Analysis & DFM (Design for Manufacturability) Checks

*   **Models**:
    *   **Supervised Learning Models (e.g., Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks)**:
        *   **Suitability**: Train models to predict potential issues based on features extracted from the layout. For example, classifying track segments as likely to cause crosstalk, or identifying areas prone to acid traps or tombstoning.
    *   **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**:
        *   **Suitability**: If layout sections are represented as images, CNNs can learn to identify visual patterns indicative of SI/PI problems (e.g., improper trace spacing, acute angles) or DFM violations.
*   **Techniques**:

This can help identify subtle issues that go beyond generic rule checkers (e.g., predicting solder bridging likelihood based on pad shapes and spacing in specific contexts).
*   **Techniques**:
    *   **Learning from Fabrication Feedback**: If feedback from manufacturers on past designs is available, this data can be used to train models to catch similar issues proactively.

### 2.5. Technical Documentation Generation Module

Automating the creation of comprehensive technical documents.

#### 2.5.1. Text Generation (Descriptions, Justifications, Guides)

*   **Models**:
    *   **Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., GPT-3.5/4, T5, BART, Flan-T5)**:
        *   **Suitability**: These models excel at generating coherent and contextually relevant text. They can be prompted to create design descriptions, explain the choice of specific components or topologies, and draft preliminary user or assembly guides.
*   **Techniques**:
    *   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
        *   **Suitability**: To ensure factual accuracy and relevance to the specific design, LLMs can be combined with a retrieval system. The retriever fetches relevant information from the project's requirements, schematic details (component names, values), layout features, and analysis results. This retrieved context is then provided to the LLM as part of the prompt, grounding its output in the actual design data.
    *   **Fine-tuning on Domain-Specific Corpora**: Fine-tune general LLMs on a corpus of electronics textbooks, datasheets, project documentation, and technical manuals to improve their understanding of electronics terminology and documentation styles.
