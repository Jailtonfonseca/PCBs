# PCBGeniusAI - Software Architecture Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the software architecture for PCBGeniusAI, a platform designed to automate the generation of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) designs from user requirements. The architecture is based on a microservices pattern to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability. Each service has a distinct responsibility and interacts with other services through well-defined APIs.

## 2. Architectural Overview

PCBGeniusAI employs a microservices architecture where each core functionality is encapsulated within an independent service. This approach allows for:
-   **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled based on demand.
-   **Flexibility**: Different technologies can be used for different services.
-   **Resilience**: Failure in one service is less likely to impact others.
-   **Maintainability**: Services can be developed, deployed, and updated independently.

Communication between services will primarily be asynchronous (e.g., using message queues) for background tasks and synchronous (e.g., REST APIs) for direct user interactions or when immediate responses are required.

## 4. Data Flow and Communication

*   **Initial Request**: User inputs requirements via the UI Service.
*   **Processing**: Requirements are sent to AI Core (NLP) and then to Schematic Generation.
*   **Design Pipeline**: Schematic data flows to PCB Layout, then to Fabrication File Generation.
*   **Data Storage**: All artifacts (requirements, schematics, layouts, fab files, AI models) are stored in the Project & AI Model Database. The Component Database is queried by relevant services.
*   **Documentation**: Technical Documentation Service pulls data from the Project & AI Model Database.
*   **User Feedback**: Generated files and documentation are made available via the UI Service.

**Communication Patterns**:
*   **Synchronous (REST APIs)**: For direct user interactions (e.g., submitting requirements, fetching project status) and immediate internal requests where a response is blocking.
*   **Asynchronous (Message Queues - e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka)**: For background tasks like schematic generation, PCB layout, and fabrication file generation. This decouples services and improves resilience. For example, the UI service might place a "generate schematic" request on a queue, and the Schematic Generation Service would pick it up.

## 5. Future Considerations

*   **Security**: Robust authentication, authorization, and data encryption mechanisms will be critical.
*   **Scalability and Performance**: Each service will need to be designed for horizontal scaling. Performance testing will be essential.
*   **Monitoring and Logging**: Centralized logging and monitoring will be implemented for all services.
*   **API Versioning**: APIs between services will be versioned to allow for independent updates.
*   **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines will be established for automated testing and deployment of services.
