# PCBGeniusAI - Conceptual UI/UX Design Description

## 1. Overall Design Philosophy

The user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for PCBGeniusAI will be guided by the following principles:

*   **Intuitive and User-Friendly**: The design will prioritize ease of use, even for users who may not be deeply familiar with complex EDA tools. Clear navigation, logical workflows, and uncluttered interfaces are key.
*   **Clean and Modern Aesthetics**: A visually appealing, minimalist design will enhance user focus and reduce cognitive load.
*   **Responsive Design**: While primarily desktop-focused due to the nature of design work, the UI will be responsive to accommodate various screen sizes and resolutions gracefully.
*   **AI as a Co-pilot**: The core interaction paradigm is "AI as a co-pilot." The user is always in control, making final decisions. AI automates tedious tasks, provides intelligent suggestions, and helps accelerate the design process, but does not take over.
*   **Clear Feedback and Explainability**: AI-generated suggestions or actions will be clearly distinguishable from user-initiated actions. Where possible, the AI will provide concise explanations for its suggestions (e.g., "This component is recommended due to its X, Y, Z parameters matching your requirements").
*   **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features or advanced settings will be revealed progressively, preventing new users from being overwhelmed, while still being accessible to power users.

## 2. Key UI Sections / Views

### 2.1. Dashboard

The Dashboard is the landing page after user login.

*   **Layout**: Clean, card-based or section-based layout.
*   **Elements**:
    *   **Welcome Message**: Personalized greeting.
    *   **Recent Projects**: A list or grid of recently accessed projects, showing thumbnails (if applicable), project names, and last modified dates. Clicking a project opens it in the Project Workspace.

## 3. Main User Workflows

### 3.1. Creating a New Project

1.  **Start**: User clicks "New Project" on the Dashboard.
2.  **Input Method Selection**: User chooses between "Natural Language," "Form-Based," or "Block Diagram" input.
3.  **Requirements Entry**: User provides input through the selected method.
4.  **AI Processing & Review**: User clicks "Process." AI interprets the input and displays structured specifications in the AI Interpretation Panel. The AI might ask clarifying questions (e.g., "You mentioned a 'fast ADC'. What is the minimum sample rate you require?").
5.  **User Approval**: User reviews, edits (if necessary), and confirms the AI-interpreted specifications.

### 3.2. Developing the Schematic

1.  **Initial Generation**: Based on approved specifications, the AI generates an initial schematic. This may include selecting components and creating basic connections for common circuit blocks.
2.  **User Review & Modification**: User examines the AI-generated schematic in the Schematic Editor View. They can:
    *   Move, add, or delete components.
    *   Manually re-wire connections.
    *   Use the AI Suggestions Panel for alternative components or circuit snippets ("How do I implement a level shifter for this signal?").
3.  **ERC & Iteration**: User runs ERC. AI helps identify errors and suggests potential fixes. User iterates on the design.

### 3.3. Laying out the PCB

1.  **Initial Placement**: User imports the netlist from the schematic. AI suggests an initial component placement optimized for routability, signal integrity, or other criteria defined in requirements.
2.  **User Refinement**: User reviews the AI placement, makes adjustments, locks critical components.
3.  **Routing**:
    *   User can manually route critical nets.
    *   User can ask AI to route specific nets or the entire board. AI provides options or highlights problematic routes.
4.  **DRC & Iteration**: User runs DRC. AI helps identify violations and suggests fixes. The user makes adjustments to placement and routing.
5.  **Advanced Insights (Future)**: AI provides feedback on SI/PI, thermal performance based on the current layout.

### 3.4. Generating Manufacturing Files

1.  **Configuration**: User navigates to the Fabrication Output View and configures parameters for Gerbers, drill files, etc.
2.  **Generation**: User clicks "Generate Files." AI generates the requested files.
3.  **BOM Review**: User reviews the BOM, potentially using AI suggestions for part alternates.
4.  **DFM Check**: AI performs advanced DFM checks on the generated Gerbers and flags potential issues, offering solutions.

### 3.5. Generating Technical Documentation

1.  **Initial Draft**: User navigates to the Documentation View. AI generates a draft document structure and populates sections with information derived from the project (requirements, schematic images, layout images, BOM summary).
2.  **User Editing**: User reviews the draft, edits text, adds custom sections, and finalizes the content using the rich text editor.
3.  **Export**: User exports the document in the desired format.

## 4. Human-in-the-Loop Interaction

*   **Clarity**: AI-generated content (schematic elements, layout routes, text) will be visually distinct (e.g., different color, dashed lines initially, specific icon).
*   **Control**: Users can always accept, reject, or modify any AI suggestion. For instance, an AI-suggested route can be deleted or re-routed manually. An AI-chosen component can be swapped.
*   **Explainability**: When AI makes a significant suggestion (e.g., choosing a complex IC, suggesting a specific layout strategy), a brief explanation will be available on hover or in the AI suggestions panel. For example:
    *   *"This component (X) was chosen because it meets your specified voltage (Y) and current (Z) requirements, and has a high availability score."*
    *   *"This placement for U5 is suggested to minimize the track length to U3, which is critical for high-speed signal integrity."*
*   **Undo/Redo**: Robust undo/redo functionality is essential, especially when dealing with AI actions that might alter the design significantly.

This conceptual UI/UX design aims to create a powerful yet accessible platform, where AI and human designers collaborate effectively to produce high-quality PCB designs.
